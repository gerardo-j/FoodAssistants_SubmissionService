Welcome to the submission backend for our food service app!

This backend is responsible for receiving and processing orders from our app users. When an order is placed through the app, it is sent to the submission backend where it is validated, stored, and forwarded to the appropriate restaurant for preparation.

The submission backend is designed to be reliable and efficient, ensuring that orders are quickly and accurately processed. It is also built with security in mind, protecting user data and payment information from unauthorized access.

To use the submission backend, simply place an order through the app as you normally would. The backend will take care of the rest, sending a confirmation of your order and updates on its status as it is prepared and delivered.

Thank you for choosing our food service app! We hope you have a great experience.
